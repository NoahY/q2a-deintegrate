This is a script for deintegrating Q2A from Wordpress.  If it works as designed, it will copy all your Wordpress users to the Q2A database and send them each an email with a new password for their account.  I threw it together in one morning, so suffice to say it may also eat your kittens.  

1) Make a backup of your database
2) Change qa-config.php for stand-alone setup (comment out the QA_WORDPRESS_INTEGRATE_PATH definition and enter the correct values for the QA_MYSL_... definitions at the top)
3) put this script somewhere on your website that allows you to run php scripts 
4) edit the values at the top of this script to fit your install
5) navigate to the script via your web browser
6) delete this script from your server
