This is a script I threw together in one morning.  Suffice to say it may eat your kittens.  

1) Make a backup of your database
2) Change qa-config.php for stand-alone setup (comment out the QA_WORDPRESS_INTEGRATE_PATH definition and enter the correct values for the QA_MYSL_... definitions at the top)
3) put this script somewhere on your website that allows you to run php scripts 
4) edit the values at the top of this script to fit your install
5) navigate to the script via your web browser
6) delete this script from your server
